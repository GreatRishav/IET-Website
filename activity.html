                    The IET Kolkata Local Network recently hosted an 8-day Machine Learning (ML) workshop for 30 students from the EIE and ECE departments. The workshop introduced core ML concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and data preprocessing, with practical applications tailored to engineering. Students explored algorithms including decision trees, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors. An interdisciplinary approach promoted collaborative learning through group projects, enhancing participants' understanding of ML’s applications in engineering. The workshop provided foundational ML skills and fostered a supportive environment for knowledge exchange.</p>

On May 7, 2024, Techno Main Salt Lake, in partnership with the IET (UK) Kolkata Local Network, hosted "Wavicle 5.0" to encourage technical learning and innovation. The event began with two technical talks: Dr. Subhamoy Maitra from the Indian Statistical Institute discussed "Quantum Computing," and Dr. Kanik Palodhi from the University of Calcutta presented on "Nanoscopy." In the second half, students from multiple institutions showcased prototypes, with 24 out of 32 abstracts selected and 17 groups presenting on May 14. Judges included Dr. K L Hassan, Dr. J.K. Roy, and Prof. Bapita Roy. Winners were Arighna Mukherjee (1st) and Ramkrishna Pandey (2nd) from Techno Main Salt Lake, and Mookul Paul (3rd) from B.P. Poddar.

            <p>

In a 15-day training program, 14 students from the IET EIE department gained foundational knowledge in Industrial Automation, focusing on industry-based automatic processes. The program began with basics in industrial controls, relay logic, and switching techniques. Students then progressed to PLC hardware and software, learning about PLC ladder programming elements like NO-NC, SPDT, and timers. Training continued with SCADA, where they practiced GUI-based industrial controls, such as motor operations and latching. Finally, students explored hybrid control systems, integrating PLC and SCADA. This program equips students to understand automatic processes in various industries, including process and packaging industries, steel plants, and manufacturing.

            <p>
                
The Institute Innovation Council (IIC), in collaboration with the CSE (AIML) and CSE (Data Science) departments and IET Kolkata, organized the “Techno Hackathon” on August 8-9, 2024, drawing together talented young minds to tackle real-world challenges with AI, ML, and data science solutions. On Day 1, 38 out of 58 registered teams presented AI-based application ideas across domains like healthcare, finance, education, and agriculture, with judges selecting ten teams to advance based on creativity and impact. Day 2 focused on business plans, where teams refined their startup ideas, showcasing technical solutions alongside market and execution strategies. The event concluded with Team Decodians (CSE AIML, TMSL) taking the top spot, followed by Pill-Pals (EIE, TMSL), Symphony Surfers (CSE DS), and MediTrack (EIE, TMSL). The hackathon was a resounding success, fostering interdisciplinary teamwork, technical skill-building, and innovation, setting a high standard for future events.
